# fluent_icu

> **Public AI agent contract** for fluent_icu — read by Cursor, OpenAI Codex, Aider, Devin, JetBrains Junie, and any AI tool that follows the [agents.md](https://agents.md) convention.
>
> Claude Code reads the deeper workspace config at `whuppi/.claude/rules/` and `whuppi/.claude/memory/` automatically — this AGENTS.md exists for every *other* AI tool.
>
> Stamped from `whuppi/AGENTS.template.md`. Per-repo content lives in the placeholder sections; everything else is identical workspace-wide.

## What this tool does

**fluent_icu** is the full-fidelity ICU4X backend for fluent_bundle — the complete ECMA-402 `NUMBER` / `DATETIME` option surface (units, calendars, time zones, numbering systems, compact, sign display) plus cardinal AND ordinal plural rules for every CLDR locale, via the icu_kit engine (native FFI + WASM + browser Intl). Same FTL, same call sites as any other backend; one constructor swaps it in.

This repo is one tool inside the **whuppi** workspace — a multi-tool monorepo. The workspace ships shared engineering standards, code conventions, brand identity, and build patterns that apply across every tool. They're documented in three layers:

- **Repo-specific architecture, design, reference:** `./docs/`
- **Workspace human-readable standards:** `../docs/` (when this repo is cloned as part of the whuppi workspace) — engineering principles, decision frameworks, secret/CI patterns
- **Workspace AI-only directives:** `../.claude/rules/` (Claude Code reads these automatically; other AI tools can read them as supplementary context)

If you're working on this tool standalone (cloned outside the workspace), the in-repo `./docs/` is your authority; ignore the workspace pointers.

## Build and test commands

Run these after every code change. A failing test or analyzer error means the task is not done — don't suppress with `// ignore:`, `# noqa`, or `--no-verify`. Fix the underlying issue.

```bash
# Setup (one-time) — needs sibling repos ../fluent_bundle and ../icu_kit
make hooks
fvm install && fvm dart pub get   # icu_kit's build hook compiles ICU4X on first test run

# Full gate
make check               # lint-shell + analyze + analyze-floor + test-guards +
                         # test (VM, native) + test-web (WASM in Chrome) + test-example
```

## Code style

Match the style of existing code in this repo first. Workspace-wide standards live at:

- **Engineering standards** (seven questions before every decision, env-blind code, twelve-factor checklist): `../docs/universal/development-standards.md`
- **Secrets and environments** (GitHub Environments, branch=env, security walls, files-not-env-vars): `../docs/universal/secrets-and-environments.md`
- **Python tools** (SDK/CLI/MCP three-layer pattern, ruff config, hatchling): `../.claude/rules/python-shared/sdk-cli-mcp-pattern.md`
- **Flutter packages** (opaque boundaries, async at edges, dependency flow): `../.claude/rules/flutter-shared/package-design.md`
- **Comments and doc-comments** (what earns a comment, what doesn't): `../.claude/rules/universal/comments.md`
- **Renaming anything** (sweep all references in one session): `../.claude/rules/universal/rename-hygiene.md`

When in doubt, read existing code in this repo and match it. Per-repo style consistency beats general-best-practice consistency.

## Tool-specific notes

- **The degrade contract is sacred.** An option ICU4X can't honor renders the nearest supported form AND records a `FluentTypeError` — never a silent drop, never a throw. The conformance harness pins both directions for every declared gap.
- **icu_kit's `@experimental` facades are confined** to `lib/src/number/styles.dart` — `make test-guards` enforces it; the analysis_options severity override is documented there, not a `// ignore:`.
- **The chrome lane asserts the SAME pinned strings as the native lane** (the byte-identical-output claim, tested literally). A new pinned output goes in BOTH suites, invisible characters as `\uXXXX` escapes.
- **`make web-assets`** installs icu_kit's WASM engine into `web/icu_kit/` (gitignored) via `dart run icu_kit:setup web`.
- **The `platforms` gate is blocked-loud pre-release** — pana can't resolve the sibling-repo path deps; the family release checklist flips it in.

## Data, secrets, and gitignore

This repo's `.gitignore` is stamped from `../.gitignore.template` (workspace canonical). It already covers:

- `data/.env` and every other `.env` flavor (only `.env.example` / `.env.template` / `.env.sample` are committed)
- `data/auth/` (captured tokens, cookies, OAuth credentials)
- `data/db/*.sqlite*` (full app state — irreplaceable)
- `cookies*.json`, `*.token`, `*.pem`, `*.key`
- `output/`, `debug/`, `logs/`, `cache/`

Never commit a sensitive file even if it's somehow not gitignored — surface to the maintainer instead. The gitignore is defense-in-depth, not the only check.

---

## Working with AI agents

- **Run the test suite before claiming completion.** Always.
- **Don't add `TODO` comments as a substitute for fixing things.** If you found it, you own it — fix in this pass or surface to the maintainer.
- **Don't add backwards-compat shims** for code that hasn't shipped. Code assumes the latest schema and contracts; migrations handle old data once.
- **Don't refactor "for cleanliness" without a stated reason.** Surface the suggestion before changing surrounding code.
- **No co-authored-by AI in commits.** The maintainer is the author.
- **Never force-push protected branches** (`prod`, `main`, `dev`). Never skip pre-commit hooks.

For the engineering philosophy that informs every line of code in this workspace, see `../.claude/rules/universal/dc-engineering-philosophy.md` if available.
